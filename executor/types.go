// Executor serves as an execution manager for running jobs on a specific backend, such as a Docker daemon.
// It provides a comprehensive set of methods to initiate, monitor, terminate, and retrieve output streams for executions.
type Executor interface {
	// Start initiates an execution for the given ExecutionRequest.
	// It returns an error if the execution already exists and is in a started or terminal state.
	// Implementations may also return other errors based on resource limitations or internal faults.
	Start(ctx context.Context, request *types.ExecutionRequest) error

	// Run initiates and waits for the completion of an execution for the given ExecutionRequest.
	// It returns a ExecutionResult and an error if any part of the operation fails.
	// Specifically, it will return an error if the execution already exists and is in a started or terminal state.
	Run(ctx context.Context, request *types.ExecutionRequest) (*types.ExecutionResult, error)

	// Wait monitors the completion of an execution identified by its executionID.
	// It returns two channels:
	// 1. A channel that emits the execution result once the task is complete.
	// 2. An error channel that relays any issues encountered, such as when the
	//    execution is non-existent or has already concluded.
	Wait(ctx context.Context, executionID string) (<-chan *types.ExecutionResult, <-chan error)

	// Cancel attempts to cancel an ongoing execution identified by its executionID.
	// Returns an error if the execution does not exist or is already in a terminal state.
	Cancel(ctx context.Context, executionID string) error

	// GetLogStream provides a stream of output for an ongoing or completed execution identified by its executionID.
	// The 'Tail' flag indicates whether to exclude hstorical data or not.
	// The 'follow' flag indicates whether the stream should continue to send data as it is produced.
	// Returns an io.ReadCloser to read the output stream and an error if the operation fails.
	// Specifically, it will return an error if the execution does not exist.
	GetLogStream(ctx context.Context, request types.LogStreamRequest) (io.ReadCloser, error)

	// List returns a slice of ExecutionListItem containing information about current executions.
	// This includes the execution ID and whether it's currently running.
